### Bio

Hi! My name is Platon and I am a junior front-end developer.  I like to find ways to solve difficult and interesting problems, and watch them come to life.  I was hooked on translating ideas from my head into a visual form with the help of code. Therefore, from the beginning of 2021, I started to study Front-end web development.
