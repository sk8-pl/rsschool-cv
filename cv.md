I`m a frontend developer.
From February 2021, I started learning web development. My perseverance and desire to learn allowed me to get my first offer after 9 months.

Now, I put that perseverance to work as a web developer. 
I am well-versed in HTML, CSS and SASS, Javascript. Webpack as the builder to build most of the web application. React + Redux is what I enjoy the most lately. I continue to study them.

Currently working as a front end developer creating a web application to help with automation fly dronessystems. This allows to remotely control the complex of drones, send them to various tasks (cargo delivery, ice scanning, field spraying, etc). When creating a flight task constructor, I used maplibre and three.js, now I'm transferring to Cesium. To build a histogram - chartist-js
